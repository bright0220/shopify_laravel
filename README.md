# Basic Shopify API

A simple, tested, API wrapper for Shopify using Guzzle. I created this to support my legacy apps. It contains helpful methods for generating a installation URL, an authorize URL, HMAC signature validation, call limits, and API requests. It works with both OAuth and private API apps.

## Installation

The recommended way to install is [through composer](http://packagist.org).

    $ composer require tyler-king/basic-shopify-api

## Usage

Coming soon!
